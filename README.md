# math_snake

A "math snake" is a math puzzle where you calculate your way through a snake-like maze.

I've created a static page and some javascript code to actually generate as many puzzles as you need and you can also vary the difficulty on the page as well. 

I've (temporarily) put it up here: http://mathsnake.rohrbach-itc.com/
